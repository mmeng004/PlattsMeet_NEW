Project Management : Adaptive Project Framework - our requirements breakdown structure is outlined by our team concept presentation.
    Project proceeds in iterative stages (sprints) and at the end of each demo, the team will evaluate previous results to
    improve performance and practices. We meet outside of class weekly (and as needed close to demo time) over zoom. Meetings are
    planned either during class or in our Discord group chat. Work hours are logged individually.

Revision Control: GitHub - https://github.com/mmeng004/PlattsMeet - commit to trunk not branches

Quality Assurance :  Customer Involvement method - each member will place themselves as the role of the customer (considering we are all
    international/transfer students, and that is our software's target audience) and test the software to meet our own needs as consumers.
    Project Co-managers Becky and Meron will also look over code and integrate/merge when necessary (like a psuedo pair programming method).

Code Review additions: 
If the code is specific to front end/back end, is the code in the right language for use with that framework?  
Is the formatting consistent?
Have design principles been applied to HTML/CSS code?
DRY? (Don't Repeat Yourself) - is any code duplicated more than twice?
What security measures are implemented?

Refactoring: if the team finds that an idea originally presented as part of a sprint is no longer necessary or doable, we will make
    improvements in our code to make those changes easier when we come to that sprint.

Agile Retrospectives Meeting Documentation: Each week we do a scrum led by Becky and documented as a summary which is appended to the 
    project in GitHub.
Sprint Retrospectives: after each sprint, each team member documents what achievements they are proud of and what can be improved.
